Amer’s Story

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a man named Bill who was considered the most wanted person in the galaxy. For millennia, no one had been able to apprehend him. However he now had a change of heart. Despite his status, he did not enjoy himself one bit, and asked himself if he should turn himself in…

Unfortunately, when Bill try to turn himself in, the inter-galaxy police does not believe that he is the real Bill but a pretender. The inter-galaxy police never got their hands in anything that can identify Bill, no fingerprint or DNA or such. Despite thinking that this person looks very close to the most wanted person in the galaxy, either by coincidence or facial-modification, they do not believe that the most wanted person in the galaxy will simply turn himself in, therefore they sent Bill away.

Bill was very sad and he decided that no matter what but he will prove everyone that he is the most wanted person in the galaxy.
Bill was mostly known for his way of destroying planets. He decide to destroy Earth and take a video to prove that it was him.
It took him twenty years to accomplish it. After destroying Earth he tried again to turn himself in the inter-galazy police. But...

The Police thought the real Bill was just manipulating this poor man to use him as a scapegoat! Surely Bill is holding the man's family hostage and using them to blackmail
him so he takes the fall for Bill. The video of destroying Earth was just a set-up. Bill had to give them credit, since it was definitely something he would have done in
his old ways, and he should have seen it coming. He had one last idea, to secretly become a super-hero, that would be on the same level as evil-Bill.

Bill thought that if there was good in the world for once, maybe people would
believe he was the most wanted person if he then followed with catastrophic evil
. So, he began on his journey to rebuild Earth and realign the cosmos. 
Over centuries, Bill was able to accomplish his goals of making the universe a 
friendly and pleasant place to live. People loved Bill for being a hero, and 
he had started to take a liking to them. From then on, Bill decided
that no evil would overcome the feeling of doing good in this universe.
