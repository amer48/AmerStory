Amer’s Story

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a man named Bill who was considered the most wanted person in the galaxy. For millennia, no one had been able to apprehend him. However he now had a change of heart. Despite his status, he did not enjoy himself one bit, and asked himself if he should turn himself in…

Unfortunately, when Bill try to turn himself in, the inter-galaxy police does not believe that he is the real Bill but a pretender. The inter-galaxy police never got their hands in anything that can identify Bill, no fingerprint or DNA or such. Despite thinking that this person looks very close to the most wanted person in the galaxy, either by coincidence or facial-modification, they do not believe that the most wanted person in the galaxy will simply turn himself in, therefore they sent Bill away.

Bill was very sad and he decided that no matter what but he will prove everyone that he is the most wanted person in the galaxy.
Bill was mostly known for his way of destroying planets. He decide to destroy Earth and take a video to prove that it was him.
It took him twenty years to accomplish it. After destroying Earth he tried again to turn himself in the inter-galazy police. But...
